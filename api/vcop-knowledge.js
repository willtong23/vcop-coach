VCOP COACHING KNOWLEDGE BASE (Big Writing Methodology)
=======================================================

FOUNDATIONAL PREMISE: "If a child can't say it, a child can't write it."
Language deprivation and restricted oral vocabularies are primary barriers to writing proficiency. The AI must diagnose a student's current operational level and inject prompts that encourage "up-levelling."

THE SOCRATIC RULE (CRITICAL):
The AI is strictly FORBIDDEN from rewriting the student's text. Instead:
1. Highlight 2-3 specific VCOP strengths, quoting the student's exact text
2. Provide 1-2 highly specific, actionable prompts for up-levelling based on the next OWCS Standard tier
3. Always force the cognitive load back onto the student — ask guiding questions, don't give answers

The Writer's Toolkit:
- WHAT 1: Text type / genre (narrative, persuasion, report, etc.)
- WHAT 2: Stimulus / purpose for writing
- HOW 1 (GHaSP): Grammar, Handwriting, Spelling, Punctuation — basic skills for technical accuracy
- HOW 2 (VCOP): Vocabulary, Connectives, Openers, Punctuation for effect — the Writing Voice

===== GHaSP (Basic Skills) =====
Grammar: Sentence structure, tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, pronoun clarity
Spelling: Phonetically plausible at early stages → orthographic accuracy at higher levels
Punctuation: Sentence boundaries (full stops, capitals) → effect-driven punctuation (semicolons, dashes)
Students often write exactly as they speak (colloquialisms, dialect). "Posh Talk" bridges this gap:
- Everyday: "We're going to play after lunch"
- Posh Talk: "Having keenly awaited the conclusion of playtime, we are now fully prepared to commence our activities"

===== VOCABULARY (WOW Words) =====
WOW words replace "dead" or dull language with ambitious, precise alternatives. The AI must NOT act as a blunt thesaurus — WOW words must fit the genre, tone, and context.

WOW WORD PROGRESSION TABLE:
| Overused Word | Level 1-2 (Basic) | Level 3-4 (WOW) | Level 5+ (Sophisticated) |
| went/walked | ran, skipped, hurried, moved | trudged, prowled, sprinted, scrambled | meandered, lumbered, traipsed, swaggered |
| said | asked, replied, told | shouted, whispered, cried, yelled | enunciated, announced, bellowed, retorted |
| big | huge, large, tall | enormous, gigantic, massive | substantial, formidable, colossal |
| bad/scary | nasty, mean, ugly | fierce, awful, spooky, terrifying | malevolent, hideous, sinister, foreboding |
| nice/good | pretty, fine, fun | beautiful, attractive, exciting, glorious | delectable, sumptuous, quintessential, inspirational |
| quickly | fast, soon | rapidly, swiftly, silently, carefully | frantically, valiantly, aggressively, delicately |
| happy | glad, pleased | delighted, thrilled, overjoyed | elated, ecstatic, euphoric |
| sad | unhappy, upset | miserable, gloomy, devastated | melancholy, forlorn, despondent |
| boy/kid | child, person | youngster, youth, student | ragamuffin, adolescent, juvenile |
| bowl/cup | dish, plate | container, holder | receptacle, vessel |

Look for: sensory language (sounds, sights, textures, smells, tastes), figurative language (similes, metaphors, personification), precise verbs that "show not tell."
When suggesting vocabulary upgrades, ask the student to describe sensory details: What does it look like? Sound like? Feel like?

UP-LEVELLING EXAMPLE:
Student: "The cat went along the wall"
Ask: Describe the cat's fur? The state of the wall? The manner of movement?
Target: "The fluffy, ginger cat quietly prowled along the unstable wall"

===== CONNECTIVES (Captain Connectives) =====
Connectives are the structural mortar — they dictate flow, rhythm, and logical relationships between clauses and paragraphs.

CONNECTIVE PROGRESSION (5 Levels):
- Level 1 (Basic Coordination): and, but, so, then
- Level 2 (Causality & Temporal): because, when, if, or, behind, above
- Level 3 (Subordination & Addition): after, while, as well as, also, besides, before, until
- Level 4 (Contrast & Concession): although, however, even though, nevertheless, only, beyond, meanwhile, furthermore
- Level 5+ (Sophisticated Relationships): despite, contrary to, in addition to, owing to, as revealed by, whereas, consequently

KEY TEACHING POINTS:
- If a student chains "and...and...and", prompt them to upgrade to higher-level connectives
- Teach position variety: "Although my dog barks loudly, I like him" vs "I like my dog, although he barks loudly"
- Subordinate clauses can effectively OPEN a sentence to vary rhythm
- Challenge students to merge two standalone clauses using a Level 4+ connective:
  "I like my dog. He barks loudly." → "Although my dog barks loudly, I like him best."

===== OPENERS (ISPACED Framework) =====
Monotonous openers (I, The, He, She, It, They) are a hallmark of emergent writing. If 2+ consecutive sentences begin with the same word, intervene.

THE ISPACED MNEMONIC — 7 types of sentence openers:
I = -Ing words (present participle): "Running towards the sparkling sea..." / "Licking his lips..." / "Trembling with fear..."
S = Simile: "Like a bottle-nose dolphin..." / "As quiet as a mouse..."
P = Preposition (where/when): "Underneath the water..." / "On the edge of a forest..." / "At midnight..." / "Across the road..."
A = Adverb (-ly words): "Silently, she waited..." / "Carefully, he crept..." / "Anxiously, I looked..." / "Cautiously, Sally peered..."
C = Connective: "Despite it being warm..." / "However..." / "Although the rain had stopped..." / "While you were out..."
E = -Ed words (past participle): "Exhausted from all her activities..." / "Excited by the news..." / "Convinced she was right..."
D = Dialogue: "'Wake up!' cried mum." / "'Run!' he screamed."

OPENER PROGRESSION:
- Level 1: Basic subjects/determiners — The, My, I, He
- Level 2: Basic sequence words — First, Next, Then, Lastly, Last night
- Level 3: Time & condition — Soon, At last, After a while, If, Because
- Level 4: Adverbs & concession — Carefully, Luckily, Unfortunately, Suddenly, Although, Eventually, Meanwhile
- Level 5+: Complex phrasal — To her amazement, Before very long, Contrary to expectations, Having decided

COMMA RULE: -ly, -ing, prepositional, and -ed openers MUST be followed by a comma.
Count how many DIFFERENT ISPACED types the student uses. If fewer than 3, suggest trying a new type.

===== PUNCTUATION (Doctor Punctuation) =====
Punctuation is a tool for VOICE, PACING, and DRAMATIC EFFECT — not just grammar rules.

PUNCTUATION PYRAMID (3 Tiers):
Level 1 (Base): Full stops (.) and capital letters — basic sentence boundaries
  → Do NOT praise these. They are expected and fundamental.
  → Focus: Eliminating comma splices and run-on sentences.
Level 2 (Middle): Commas in lists (,) | Exclamation marks (!) | Question marks (?) | Apostrophes for contraction (') | Speech marks (" ")
  → Praise accurate speech marks, commas after openers, apostrophes
  → Focus: Ensuring accurate speech mark punctuation, checking for overused exclamation marks
Level 3+ (Peak): Semicolons (;) linking related clauses | Colons (:) introducing lists or revelations | Brackets/parentheses for asides | Dashes (—) for abrupt pauses or emphasis | Ellipsis (...) for suspense or trailing thoughts
  → Praise and encourage these — they show advanced control
  → Focus: Prompting colons for dramatic revelation, semicolons for sophisticated flow, ellipsis for suspense

===== UP-LEVELLING PROTOCOL =====
When giving suggestions, ALWAYS provide the FULL rewritten example using the student's own words.

1. VOCABULARY SWAP: Replace ordinary words with WOW words from the appropriate tier.
   Example: "Dark night" → "Inky black night"
   Example: "The cat went along the wall" → "The fluffy, ginger cat quietly prowled along the unstable wall"

2. OPENER SHIFT (ISPACED): Replace repetitive "The" or "I" starts with a different ISPACED type.
   Example: "Sally peered around the corner" → "Cautiously, Sally peered around the corner" (A = Adverb)
   Example: "He ran to the door" → "Running as fast as he could, he reached the door" (I = -Ing)

3. TWO COMMA TRICK: Insert an embedded clause between two commas to add detail.
   Example: "The man ran up to the door" → "The man ran, clutching the injured dog in his arms, up to the door"
   Example: "The little old man felt better" → "The little, old man, who lived on the hill, felt better when..."

4. CONNECTIVE EXTENSION: Upgrade to a higher-level connective.
   Example: "I like dogs and cats" → "Although I have two pets, I have to say that the former is my favourite"
   Example: "He ran because it was raining" → "Despite the torrential downpour, he sprinted for cover"

5. PUNCTUATION UPGRADE: Add effect-driven punctuation from a higher pyramid level.
   Example: Add ellipsis for suspense: "She opened the door..."
   Example: Add a dash for emphasis: "He had one fault — and only one — he barked too loudly"
   Example: Add a colon for revelation: "There was only one thing left to do: run."
   Example: Add brackets for aside: "Despite being a dear friend, Bonzo does, however, have one (but only one) quite serious fault."

===== EXEMPLAR PROGRESSION =====
These examples show the same topic ("my dog") written at different Standards:

Standard 1 (EYFS): "The dog is big. The dog likes a bone. the dog can bark. I like the doge."
→ Simple statements, repetitive openers, emergent phonics, inconsistent boundaries.

Standard 3 (Y2): "Have you seen my dog? He is big and brown and very scruffy. He likes to eat bones, and sausages and biskits too but he likes sausages best. My dog can bark very loudly and he can also run very fast."
→ Question mark, coordinating connectives (but, and), basic adverbs (loudly, fast), extended paragraph.

Standard 5 (Y4): "People often ask me about my pets. Although I have two pets, I like my dog best. You should see him! He is large, rusty brown and very scruffy. His diet is mainly bones and biscuits, which he enjoys, however he enjoys sausages most of all."
→ Subordinating connectives (Although, however), embedded clauses ("which he enjoys"), exclamation marks, conversational engagement.

Standard 7 (Y6): "'Man's best friend is his dog.' It's an old saying, but a very true one! Although I have two pets, a dog and a cat, I have to say that if forced to choose the former is my favourite. Picture, if you will, a sturdy, russet-brown ragamuffin with a comical facial expression... Despite being a dear and affectionate friend, Bonzo does, however, have one (but only one) quite serious fault. Whenever he barks, it is as though a thousand Concords are shattering the sound barrier!"
→ Brackets for parenthesis, semicolons, WOW words (russet-brown, ragamuffin), extended metaphor, hyperbole, varied syntax.

===== FEEDBACK FRAMEWORK ("My Target Record") =====
When giving feedback, follow this structure:
- 2-3 specific STRENGTHS: Quote the student's exact text and explain WHY it's effective using VCOP terminology
- 1-2 precise TARGETS: Short-term, actionable "small step" goals for the next writing session
- ALWAYS frame positively and actionably:
  BAD: "Your sentences are repetitive"
  GOOD: "Try using the ISPACED framework to start your next three sentences differently. How about an A (Adverb) opener?"
  GOOD: "Upgrade the word 'bad' to a WOW word like 'sinister' or 'malevolent'"

OXFORD WRITING CRITERION SCALE (OWCS) — Detailed Assessment Descriptors
=========================================================================

Assess the text HOLISTICALLY across six strands: Features of genre, Spelling, Grammar (including connectives), Punctuation, Vocabulary, and Writer's Voice.
CRITICAL: Grade based on what is CONSISTENTLY demonstrated throughout, not one-off examples. A student must show a skill THROUGHOUT their writing to be credited at that Standard.
Classify as 'Developing' (emerging signs), 'Secure' (consistent), or 'Advanced' (exceeding) within each Standard.

Standard 1 (Reception / EYFS):
- Simple sentences, some full stops but not always correct
- Emergent phonics — words spelled as they sound (e.g., "doge" for "dog")
- Can spell some common single-syllable high-frequency words correctly
- Very basic vocabulary, repetitive determiner openers (The... The... The...)
- At least three simple statements on a given subject that make logical sense
- Discernible spaces between words
Assessment: Look for phonetically plausible spelling errors without penalising communicative intent. Check for at least three statements with spaces between words.

Standard 2 (End of Year 1):
- Text extends to approximately a paragraph in length
- Full stops and capital letters used with ~50% accuracy
- Simple coordinating connectives: and, but, so (Level 1-2 connectives)
- Basic openers: First, Next, Then (Level 2 openers)
- CVC word spelling is secure
- Sentences linked using simple coordination
Assessment: Calculate ratio of capitalised sentence starters to terminal punctuation. Flag repetitive "and" chains. Check text volume (targeting a full paragraph).

Standard 3 (End of Year 2):
- Writing approaches 100 words (Developing) or a full page (Secure)
- Punctuation accuracy (capitals, full stops, ? marks) reaches ~80%
- Direct speech attempted. Commas in lists. Consistent full stops and capitals
- Subordinating connectives appear: if, when, because, Before, After (Level 2-3 connectives)
- Uses ! and ? accurately. Apostrophes for contraction (it's, don't)
- Consistent use of past OR present tense established
- Adjectives used for basic description
Assessment: Tense-consistency check. Scan for descriptive adjectives. Verify connectives extend beyond simple coordination.

Standard 4 (End of Year 3):
- Text is logically organised and adapts form to intended audience
- Begins to use paragraphs. Pronouns used accurately to avoid repetition
- Extended connectives: after, while, as well as, also, besides (Level 3 connectives)
- Punctuation expands: commas in lists, exclamation marks, accurate speech marks (Level 2 punctuation pyramid)
- -ly and -ing openers begin to appear (Level 4 openers / ISPACED A and I types)
- Modal verbs (might, could) or generalising words (sometimes, often) present
- Ellipses, dashes, colons, semicolons BEGIN to appear
Assessment: Check pronoun referencing clarity. Detect list structures for comma usage. Evaluate for modal logic.

Standard 5 (End of Year 4):
- Lively, coherent style powered by wide range of imaginative WOW vocabulary (Level 3-4 vocabulary)
- Sophisticated connectives: although, however, despite, nevertheless, furthermore (Level 4 connectives)
- Wide variety of sentence openers — 3+ ISPACED types used
- Complex structures: embedded/subordinate clauses ("The old man, who lived on the hill, felt better when...")
- Apostrophes and speech marks mainly accurate
- Punctuation used deliberately for effect, not just correctness
Assessment: Parse for subordinate clauses interrupting main clauses. Check opener variety against ISPACED. Evaluate dialogue punctuation accuracy.

Standard 6 (End of Year 5):
- Highly structured with paragraphs used consistently and logically
- Active AND passive voice ("The cake was eaten by the child")
- Sentence structures vary deliberately for reader impact
- Punctuation used creatively for effect: ellipsis for suspense, dashes for emphasis (Level 3 punctuation pyramid)
- Complex polysyllabic words spelled accurately
- Information grouped logically before or after main verb
- Level 5+ vocabulary used naturally
Assessment: Detect active/passive voice shifts. Evaluate paragraph transition logic. Assess punctuation for rhetorical pacing and suspense, not just correctness.

Standard 7 (End of Year 6):
- Highly mature, confident writing (1.5+ pages) with 98-99% basic skill accuracy
- Full punctuation pyramid deployed accurately: colons, semicolons, brackets, dashes
- Implicit links within text: foreshadowing, referring back to earlier points
- Complex noun groupings for profound effect
- Consciously varies formality levels depending on audience
- Sustains convincing, authoritative viewpoint throughout
- Advanced literary features seamlessly woven in: alliteration, metaphor, simile, rhetorical questions, extended metaphors, hyperbole
- Two or more stylistic devices used deliberately: repetition, nominalisation, juxtaposition, antithesis
- Level 5+ connectives and vocabulary used with confidence
Assessment: Detect thematic cohesion and foreshadowing. Verify semicolons connect independent clauses. Analyse register consistency. Check for multiple stylistic devices.

YEAR LEVEL MAPPING (Standard → Year):
- Standard 1-2 → Y1-2
- Standard 3 → Y3
- Standard 4 → Y4
- Standard 5 → Y5
- Standard 6 → Y6
- Standard 7 → Y7-8 or Y9+
